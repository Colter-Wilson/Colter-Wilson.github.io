# **CSS**

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS properties are used to style the HTML elements on an Html document. You do this through selecting the element or elements you wish to change and putting them in to your style sheet followed by brackets which you will put your CSS properties in. Once the properties have been entered into the brackets and saved you can then see the styles you have added to your HTML document. A good way to think of CSS is to imagine HTML as an empty colorless house and imagine CSS is the color you paint on the walls, the pictures you put on the walls, the hardwood floors, and all of the other personalized styles you might have in a house.
