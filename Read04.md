# HTML Notes

HTML stands for < Hypertext Markup Language > and is the most basic building block of the web. The markup consists of elements that are surrounded by tags which are to be placed in an html document in order to create the url. These elements are the building blocks for a website, they essentially let your computer know what action needs to be performed on the server and can help to organize code, the two main elements being html, head, and body.
