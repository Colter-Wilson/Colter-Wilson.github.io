## Command Line

The command line or terminal is a text based interface to the system. The command line will first present you with a prompt message upon opening it, something like "colter@DESKTOP-GSPST28:~/projects/courses/Lab45678$". After the prompt you will be able to type in the command followed by a command line argument which will modify the behavior of your command, there has to be a a space between the agrument and command or it will not run the command you wish it to execute. Once you have typed the command and command argument you press enter and your command will provide an output and begin running. After the command has run you will be returned to a prompt message and can execute another command.

You can find the command line for Linux in Applications -> System or Applications -> Utilities.

### Basic Navigation

#### Basic Navigation Commands

In order to navigate to the correct place in your system there are specific commands to get there. The three essential commands are;

pwd
Print Working Directory - ie. Where are we currently.

ls
List the contents of a directory.

cd
Change Directories - ie. move to another directory.

#### Navigation Paths

There are two paths when changing locations in the system. Each path will get you where you need to go but are finding your location in the system differently. 

Relative path- A file or directory location relative to where we currently are in the file system.

Absolute path- A file or directory location in relation to the root of the file system.

Relative path example- ls Documents

file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt

Absolute path example- ls /home/ryan/Documents

file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt

## About Files 

Everything in Linux is a file. When moving from place to place remember you are just hopping from file to file. The files are case and space sensitive so make sure that you are typing the exact name of your files. Lastly Linux is extentionless meaning that files can have any extension they want or no exstension at all. Below are file extension examples.

file.exe - an executable file, or program.
file.txt - a plain text file.
file.png, file.gif, file.jpg - an image.
