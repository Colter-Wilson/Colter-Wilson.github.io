## Command Line

The command line or terminal is a text based interface to the system. The command line will first present you with a prompt message upon opening it, something like "colter@DESKTOP-GSPST28:~/projects/courses/Lab45678$". After the prompt you will be able to type in the command followed by a command line argument which will modify the behavior of your command, there has to be a a space between the agrument and command or it will not run the command you wish it to execute. Once you have typed the command and command argument you press enter and your command will provide an output and begin running. After the command has run you will be returned to a prompt message and can execute another command.

You can find the command line for Linux in Applications -> System or Applications -> Utilities.
