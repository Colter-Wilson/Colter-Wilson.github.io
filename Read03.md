# Revisions and The Cloud

## Git

Git is a DVCS created in 2005 that stores data from projects you are working on in snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your work it creates a commit which is what will then be sent to a file as a snapshot. This allows developers to worry less about losing their work by knowing that Git has saved your latest changes. For this reason it has become one of the most popular version control systems in the world.

Git can reside in three main states: committed, modified, and staged. When a file is committed the data is secure in a database, modified files have been changed but not saved to the database, and lastly a staged file is a file that will be committed in the next snapshot. 

## Git Examples

Git commit all changes- "git commit -a"
