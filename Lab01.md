# *What Growth Mindset Means to Me*

What having a growth mindset means to me is the ability to learn from yours and others mistakes through keeping a posotive outlook on failure by accepting it as the first step to being successful and realizing each person has their own unique path to success.

## *Reminders to Keep Yourself in a Growth Mindset*

- Don't concern yourself with the pace of other's, be happy with your own pace and the improvement you are making.
- Keep in mind that failure is your first step to success.
- Never be afraid to ask for help when you're stuck.
