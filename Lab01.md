# *What Growth Mindset Means to Me*

What having a growth mindset means to me is the ability to learn from yours and others mistakes through keeping a posotive outlook on failure by accepting it as the first step to being successful and realizing each person has their own unique path to success.

## *Reminders to Keep Yourself in a Growth Mindset*

- Don't concern yourself with the pace of other's, be happy with your own pace and the improvement you are making.
- Keep in mind that failure is your first step to success.
- Never be afraid to ask for help when you're stuck.

# *Markdown*

Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text. Many different applications use markdown including Github, which is what I am using markdown through currently! Other markup languages such as HTML require a specific text editor such as VSCode to be able to run the code, but with Markup I'm able to just use a plain text editor to write my code. The code that is written is also much more simple than other markup languages, instead of using tags, elements, stylesheets, etc. I am able to just use basic syntax  to create my code, making writing markup an extremely teachable language. Down below I am going to give some visual examples of markdown in use so that you can better understand the language!

## *Markdown Examples*

### Header Examples

- "#" + your header = an H1 element.
- "##" + your header = an H2 element.
- "###" + your header = an H3 element.
- Each hashtag added will create the next level of header.

### Bold and Italics Examples

- ** around any text will create italicized text.
- ** ** around any text will creare bold text.
