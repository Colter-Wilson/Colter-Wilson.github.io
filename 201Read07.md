## Domain Modeling

### Explain why we need domain modeling.

Domain modeling allows us to understand specific problems and execute them as efficiently as possible.

## HTML Table Basics

### Why should tables not be used for page layouts?

Tables reduce accessibility, they are harder to debug, maintain, and write, and tables are sized according to their content.


### List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML <table>.
  
Thead which contains the table data that makes up the tables header, tbody which holds the table data in the body of the table, and tfoot which holds the table data held in the footer of the table.
  
## Introducing Constructors

### What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?
  
A constructor is a function that allows you to create several objects. It is much more efficient than having to write out several different object literals and repeat yourself each time.

### How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?
  
This when used in a constructor can be binded to the object and used in place.
  
## Object Prototypes Using A Constructor
  
### Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.
NOTE: This is a very common front end developer interview question
  
prototypes and inheritance are kind of like the manager at a work place, they get there directions directly from the boss or 'parent' and deliver the orders down the the rest of the workers the 'children'.
  
## What I would like to know more about
  
I would like to learn more on constructors and the way they function in real world coding scenarios.
