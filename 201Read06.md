## JavaScript Object Basics

### How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?

An object is a word in Javascript that can store several pieces of information in it.

### What are some advantages to creating object literals?

An object literal is more efficient because it sends a single object and arrays are easier to work with.

###How do objects differ from arrays?

You call on the items stored in an object ny name instead of index number.

### Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead of dot notation.

### Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using this?

const dog = {
  name: 'Spot',
  age: 2,
  color: 'white with black spots',
  humanAge: function (){
    console.log(`${this.name} is ${this.age*7} in human years`);
  }
}

This refers to the dog in this case and is useful as a simplified way of using the object you are in without having to specifically use its name each time.
