#### *What Growth Mindset Means to Me*


What a Growth Mindest means to me is having the ability to learn and grow regardless of the situation you are in. Instead of letting failure get them down someone with a growth mindset would be accepting of the challenge and realize that in the end regardless of the result they will be in a better place than when they started simply because they kept a positive mindset. 

##### *Tips for Keeping a Growth Mindset*

-When you start getting too stressed out just take a step back, take some deep breathes, and slow down your pace.

-Look at failure as the first step to success, to succeed you have to fail a million times.

-Have confidence in your work, this will allow you to produce better work and learn from constructive criticism more easily.
