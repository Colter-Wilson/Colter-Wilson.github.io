## *What Growth Mindset Means to Me*


What a Growth Mindest means to me is having the ability to learn and grow regardless of the situation you are in. Instead of letting failure get them down someone with a growth mindset would be accepting of the challenge and realize that in the end regardless of the result they will be in a better place than when they started simply because they kept a positive mindset. 

### *Tips for Keeping a Growth Mindset*

-When you start getting too stressed out just take a step back, take some deep breathes, and slow down your pace.

-Look at failure as the first step to success, to succeed you have to fail a million times.

-Have confidence in your work, this will allow you to produce better work and learn from constructive criticism more easily.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Colter-Wilson/Colter-Wilson.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
