#### *What Growth Mindset Means to Me*


What a Growth Mindest means to me is having the ability to learn and grow regardless of the situation you are in. Instead of letting failure get them down someone with a growth mindset would be accepting of the challenge and realize that in the end regardless of the result they will be in a better place than when they started simply because they kept a positive mindset. 

##### *Tips for Keeping a Growth Mindset*

-When you start getting too stressed out just take a step back, take some deep breathes, and slow down your pace.

-Look at failure as the first step to success, to succeed you have to fail a million times.

-Have confidence in your work, this will allow you to produce better work and learn from constructive criticism more easily.

## HTML

HTML stands for <Hypertext Markup Language< and is the most basic building block of the web. The markup consists of elements that are surrounded by tags which are to be placed in an html document in order to create the url. These elements are the building blocks for a website, they essentially let your computer know what action needs to be performed on the server and can help to organize code, the two main elements being html, head, and body.
