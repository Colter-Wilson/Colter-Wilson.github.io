# Operators and Loops

## Compariosn and Assignment Operators

An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. The simple assignment operator is equal (=), which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand. That is, x = f() is an assignment expression that assigns the value of f() to x.

A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true. The operands can be numerical, string, logical, or object values.

### Examples

- Assignment Operator; x = f()

- Comparison Operator; Not equal (!=)

## For and While Statement Loops

A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.

A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true.

### Examples

- For loop; for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression])
 
 statement
 
 - While loop; while (condition)
 
 statement
