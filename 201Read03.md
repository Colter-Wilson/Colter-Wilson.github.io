### The Box Model

#### Describe the CSS properties of margin and padding as characters in a story. What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”?

If the content in the very middle of the box model is a princess and the other unwanted evil content near her is trying to get close to her but she is protected by her trusted guard the "box model" the margin is her first line of defense thats on the front line closest to the other content, while she can't see them they are making sure other content keeps their distance. The padding is her personal guard that stays with her at all times, they surround her as her last line of defense.

#### List and describe the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the box model.

The border is the border that holds in the content and padding and you are able to see it. The margin seperates the rest of the box model from other content and isn't visible.

## Learn JS

### Arrays, Operators, and Expressions. Conditionals and Loops.

#### What data types can you store inside of an Array?

Strings, numbers, objects, and other arrays.

#### Is the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?

const people = [['pete', 32, 'librarian', null], ['Smith', 40, 'accountant', 'fishing:hiking:rock_climbing'], ['bill', null, 'artist', null]];

No it's not a legit array.

#### List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do.

x = f() assigns a variable a value, x += f() assigns a variable an added value, x -= f() assigns a variable a subtracted value, x *= f() assigns a variable a multiplied value, x /= f() assigns a variable a divided value.

#### Read the code below and evaluate the last expression and explain what the result would be and why.



#### Describe a real world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program.

If someone were to say they got pumched in the face then you could use a conditional statement to say "that hurt" and if they dodged the punch could say "good dodge".
