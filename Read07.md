# Programming with JavaScript

## Control Flow

The control flow is the order that the CPU reads and executes statements in script. The code is run from top to bottom unless a condition which changes this order is implemented such as loops, functions, and conditionals. Because of this it is key to state the value of a variable before it is called, your code needs to be in the correct order or the CPU will not be able to read and execute it properly.

## Functions

In JavaScript a function is a block of code written to perform a certain task which allows you to reuse code. Functions are used by being invoked, which can be done many different ways including pressing a button, using JS code, or self invoked. The function will only stop executing once it reaches a return.

## Operator 

An operator is a special symbol used to perfom operations and operands. There are four categories of Operators arithmetic, comparison, assignment, and logical.

### Examples

The multiplication operator * multiplies numbers.

The addition operator + adds numbers.

The += assignment operator can also be used to add strings.

The subtraction Operator - is used to subtract numbers.

The equal to Operator == is used to show values equal to each other.
